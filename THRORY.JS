4.) Symbol's return type is different though it's input is same. Basically Symbol return unique value everytime
    ***Every time you call Symbol(), it creates a new, unique value, even if you pass the same description (input).

const id_1 = Symbol(1)
const id_2 = Symbol(1)

console.log(id_1 == id_2)  // False
console.log(typeof id_1)   
console.log(id_1, id_2)
