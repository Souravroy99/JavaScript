/*
✅ Definition of "Event Loop" in short

The Event Loop is the mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous, non-blocking operations by coordinating between the call stack, Web APIs, and the callback queue — making single-threaded JS behave like it’s multitasking.


** So, Event Loop makes JS as asynchronous and multitasking

** All the callback functions comes through "Promises", enters into "microtask queue"

** Priority of "microtask queue" is higher than "callback queue"
